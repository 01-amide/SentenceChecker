Sentence Analyzer Algorithm
This project implements a simple algorithm called sentenceCheck that processes a sentence and counts the number of characters, words, and vowels in it. The algorithm stops processing when it reaches a period (.), which is expected to mark the end of the sentence.

ðŸ“‹ Features
âœ… Counts the number of characters in the sentence (including the period).

âœ… Counts the number of words (based on spaces).

âœ… Counts both lowercase and uppercase vowels (a, e, i, o, u).

ðŸ“Œ Notes
The sentence must end with a period (.) for the loop to stop properly.

Punctuation other than the final period is not specially handled.

The word count is estimated based on space characters.
